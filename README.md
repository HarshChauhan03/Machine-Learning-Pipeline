# 🚀 Machine Learning Pipeline

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **Machine Learning pipeline** for predicting house prices using features such as area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

The pipeline follows a structured approach used in real-world ML systems, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

The final model is deployed using a **Streamlit web application**, enabling users to input data and get real-time predictions.
